\
This is the first prototype edition.\
\
You can just add the zip file as existing project in \
IDE. \
In this case you have to add the itext.jar\
library as external jar library to work  and \
run the project.\
\
In this prototype you can see the application\'92s \
 forms and some functionality of \
 buttons.\
\
The program starts from myLogin.java. The\
form myLogin starts and ask the user to \
insert username(= admin ) and pass (= adminah).\
This username and password is just for the prototype purpose.\
\
After login the menu forms open where you can see some buttons\
(no all buttons work).  \
At category Customer, view , add new  and edit/deleted button\
have some functionality. Basically the do what they just their names \
say.\
\
The proforma and invoice buttons have some fuctionality too.\
The profroma button generates a pdf document(PROFORMA), and the invoice button \
generates pdf documents too.(INVOICE,RECEIPT)}
